# Three Observable Trends:

1. Temperature increases as latitude approaches 0. This is shown in the Max Temp vs Latitude graphs for both the northern and southern hemispheres
2. There is weak to no correlation between latitude and humidity as the r-values for these graphs are relatively low
3. There is virtually no correlation between latitude and wind speed
